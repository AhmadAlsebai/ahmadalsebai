# Hi, I'm Ahmad Alsebai!

I'm a mechanical engineer turned application engineer for automobile technology at Jetter AG, located near Stuttgart. With a background in mechanical engineering, I have expanded my skillset to include software programming for embedded systems and automation control. I am always eager to learn new things and stay up to date with the latest technology.

In addition to my work, I am passionate about technology and have completed a Master's degree in Mechatronics (Cyber Physical System) from Debrecen University in Hungary.

I'm excited to share my projects and collaborate with others in the Github community.
